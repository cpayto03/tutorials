	<!--how to add a table
	1. use the table tag
	2. add an attribute such as border to be able to see 
	the seperation lines of the table and set it to 1px
	3. use the width attribute to make the table wider and 
	set it to however many pixels you want it 
	or use a percentage such as 100% to make the table the 
	width of the browser which makes the table responsive
	4. use the cellpadding attribute to add spacing around
	the text in each table cell
	5. use the cellspacing attribute to add spacing between the cells-->
	<table border="1" width="100%" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10">
		<!--tr is for table row-->
		<tr>
			<!--th is for table header
			this tag will make the heading of 
			the column bold and centered-->
			<th>table header 1</th>
			<th>table header 2</th>
			<!--if you want a header to cover more than 1 column
			then use the attribute colspan and set it to 
			how many columns you want it to go through-->
			<th colspan="2">table header 3</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
